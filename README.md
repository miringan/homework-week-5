This repository contains files that create a calendar app that allows users to add events to a 9 hour workday schedule. The files that contribute to this app are an HTML, CSS, and javascript file. The javascript file dynamically writes elements to the HTML file utilizing the jquery API. The app logs time slots for each hour of the work day, from 9 AM to 5 PM. When a user wants to create an event on the app, they will type in a description of the event in the text area of the corresponding hour and click on the save button in that time slot. After every refresh, each time slot will display the event that the user last saved on the app. The time slots will also change color depending on whether that hour of the day has passed, is the current hour, or is in the future.
